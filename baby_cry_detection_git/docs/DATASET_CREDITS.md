**Class Balance: 4,557 cry / 4,707 non-cry (0.968:1 ratio - well-balanced)**

**Dataset Evolution:**

  - Filtered out 883 snoring files and 500 synthetic files from ICSD
  - Added 69 unique cries from Hugging Face (after removing 1,128 duplicates/mislabeled)
  - Added 57 unique cries from Kaggle (after removing 997 duplicates)
  - Added 1,423 cries from CryCeleb2023 dataset
  - Total cry samples increased: 696 -> 4,557 (+554%)
  - Reduced adult_speech: 4,481 -> 2,241 (50% reduction for better balance)
  - Added additional environmental sounds: 1,960 -> 2,110
  - Class imbalance improved: 1:9.77 -> 0.968:1 (well-balanced)
  - Added .3gp and .mp3 format support
  - All cry samples are real recordings (no synthetic audio)

**Consolidation History:**
- Merged baby_laugh and silence into baby_noncry (356 total)
- Removed duplicate ESC-50 files (noncry/household were duplicates)
- Renamed noise_speech to adult_speech for clarity
- Organized by sound type rather than source for better model logic
- Consolidated cry_1 and cry_2 temporary folders into main cry folder
- Created cry_ICSD with real recordings (strong + weak labels)
- Filtered ICSD: removed snoring (883) and synthetic (500) files for acoustic quality
- Archived original ICSD_cry folder structure
- Added cry_crycaleb with CryCeleb2023 dataset (1,423 files)
